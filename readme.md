## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

70% of young Europeans (22-35) can't afford €200k+ apartments. They're trapped paying 40-75% of income on rent with zero ownership building.

Our Solution: Open app → AI shows "properties you can afford for €500" → One tap to buy €100 piece → Instant ownership certificate

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone & Setup
git clone https://github.com/indrad3v4/team-realized.git
cd team-realized
pip install -r requirements.txt
### 2. Environment Setup...
# Create .env file

DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_key
POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://localhost/teamrealized
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
### 3. Run the Platform...

### 🤖 AI Stack Integration
- Fast.ai: Property image & feature extraction
- PyTorch: Deep learning price prediction models  
- OpenAI Agents SDK: Multi-step property analysis workflows
- DeepSeek v3.1: Advanced reasoning for undervaluation detection
- 50+ European Cities: Real-time market scanning

## 💡 Key Features

### For Users (Young European Renters)
✅ €500 Budget → Property Ownership: AI finds affordable opportunities  
✅ One-Tap €100 Investment: As easy as ordering coffee  
✅ Instant Ownership Certificates: Solana blockchain SPL tokens  
✅ 50+ Cities Coverage: Krakow, Berlin, Prague, Barcelona, Warsaw...  

### For Developers
✅ Clean Architecture: Maintainable, testable, scalable  
✅ AI-First Design: Production-ready ML pipeline  
✅ Async/FastAPI: High-performance API backend  
✅ Progressive Web App: No-install mobile experience  

## 🎮 How It Works (User Journey)
1. Open App (PWA)
     ↓
2. AI Shows: "Properties in Krakow you can afford for €500"
     ↓  
3. Select Property → AI Analysis: "This apartment is 15% undervalued"
     ↓
4. One Tap: "Buy €100 piece"
     ↓
5. Instant: "You own 0.05% of Krakow Apartment #1247"
     ↓
6. Certificate in wallet + Portfolio tracking
## 🔧 Development

### Phase 1: MVP Core (6-8h)...
# Core property feed & city scanning
python -m src.adapters.ai_models  # Test AI integration
python -m src.api.app             # Launch API
### Phase 2: AI Analysis (8-12h)...
# Deep learning models + undervaluation detection
pytest src/tests/test_ai_models.py
### Phase 3: Blockchain (6-10h)...
# One-tap Solana purchases + certificates
python -m src.adapters.blockchain
### Phase 4: Production (4-6h)...
# PWA optimization + deployment
docker-compose up --build
## 🧪 Testing...
# Run all tests
pytest

# Test AI models
pytest src/tests/test_ai_models.py -v

# Test API endpoints  
pytest src/tests/test_api.py -v

# Load testing
locust -f tests/load_test.py

## 🚀 Quick Demo Commands
# 1. Start the AI analysis engine
python -c "
from src.adapters.ai_models import AIModelsService
import asyncio

async def demo():
    ai = AIModelsService()
    opportunities = await ai.find_affordable_opportunities(user_budget=500.0)
    print(f'Found {len(opportunities)} investment opportunities!')
    for opp in opportunities[:3]:
        print(f'- {opp.city}: €{opp.min_investment_amount} for {opp.undervaluation_percentage:.1f}% undervalued property')

asyncio.run(demo())
"

# 2. Launch full platform
python main.py
Built with ❤️ in Krakow for young Europeans who deserve to own property, not just rent it forever.
